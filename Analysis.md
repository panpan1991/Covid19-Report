## Analysis of Death Rate

Interpretations of Logistic model on Death Rate:

- Among all medical occupations, females are more likely to die from the infection of Covid19 according to the data.

- Among all medical occupations, the estimated conditional odds ratio between the death of Covid19 and gender is $\exp(-0.8425)=0.43$. 

- Among male medical works, the estimated odds of death of Covid19  is just $0.43\%$ of that in female ones.

  

- Among both genders of infected medical workers, nurses are more likely to die than physicians and other medical staffs.

- Among a specific gender, the estimated odds that physicians die from Covid19 infection is $\exp(-2.3956)$ times the estimated odds for nurses.
- Among a specific gender, the estimated odds that other medical staffs die from Covid19 infection is $\exp(-2.3956)$ times the estimated odds for nurses.



Interpretations of General Linear Model on Infected cases:

- According to the data, male medical works are slightly more likely to be infected by Covid19.
- In each category of occupation and location, the number of infected male medical workers is $\exp(-0.88)=0.41$ more than that of females.
- Nurses are slightly less likely to be infected by Covid19 than physicians and other medical staffs.
- Among both genders, there are $\exp(-0.42)=0.66$  more physicians infected than nurses. 
- There are $\exp(-1.05)=0.35$ more other medical staffs infected than nurses.

- In Hubei province, medical workers are more likely to be infected. 
- There are $\exp(5.72)=305$ more medical workers infected in Hubei than in other provinces.
